            <h1>Concluding Thoughts:</h1>
            <p>
                I would say that I have enjoyed my experience with React and Node.js. Before using both frameworks I was expecting both of them to offer features that would make 
                frontend and backend web development more efficient than the normal HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP method. After
                having used both frameworks I would say that React and Node have met my expectations. The thing I liked most about React was it allowed my code to be more modular. 
                I could create an element and then import it into other parts of the webpage, this saved me from writing a lot of redundent code. Overall I would say both frameworks met
                my expectations. Creating pages was also similar to regular HTML and CSS except you can create elements and then use them in the page you created. 
                 Both frameworks were also simple to install and configure, all you needed to do
                was install Node.js and run a few commands on the terminal to get a project up and running. I would say the learning curve for React is not too difficult if you
                are already familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In React the code you write is a combination of HTML and JavaScript so there was some familiarity, but React also
                does have a few nuances that you have to become familiar with when using the framework. Overall, if you are already familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript React should not
                be too difficult to learn. I personally found the learning curve for Node to be much higher, although I feel this was mainly due to not being as familiar with JavaScript and 
                backend web development. I feel that if someone is comfortable in JavaScript then learning Node should not be too difficult. If I had to do things differently I would maybe
                choose a backend framework that uses a language that I am more familiar with, but overall I would say that I was pleased with using React and Node.js and I do not regret my choice
                of frameworks.
